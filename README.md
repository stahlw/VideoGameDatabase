# VideoGameDatabase
The video game database has the potential to store all games made, sorting them based on who published, who developed, and the people who played the games. 
The database is not currently active, as it originally was designed to only run briefly off the servers at the University of Washington. The original source code that allows you to manipulate the database was done in java and can be run, but nothing will actually be added to the database.
